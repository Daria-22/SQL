RESULT:
Error: no such table: users

/* finally explanation:
The key to this attack is 
the quote (') that closes the string in our INSERT. After that point, the rest of the user's "email address" string is executed as SQL code.
This technique is one of the most common security exploits on the Internet. It's called a "SQL injection attack" because the attacker injects
their own SQL code into our database query. That makes this the most important lesson in this SQL course!
