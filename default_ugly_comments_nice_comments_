/*Imagine that we're writing a system where users can write comments to each other. Unfortunately, comments can get ugly. Define a comments table:

The comment_text column has type TEXT.
The flag column has type INTEGER, but is used as a boolean: it's set to 1 if a moderator "flags" the comment as inappropriate.
The flag column should default to 0: we assume that a comment is nice by default.
